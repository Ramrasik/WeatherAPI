# WeatherAPI
openWeatherAPI

This is a basic Servlet program. 
This connects with the open API provided for openwaethermap.org.
In this project I had to get the data for various given states and print out
the weather temperature for 5 consecutive days for each of given state.
I would also have to calculate an average precipitation based on the data and indicated if it is raining or not.
